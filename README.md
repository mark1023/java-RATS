Java RATS (Reliable Administration and Translation Service)

This is a program written in Java that I completed as coursework for my MSc Computer Science.

The idea behind this program is that it is designed for a company (RATS company) who provide staff for adminstration and translation services for other companies.

It allows users (a manager of the RATS company) to add customers and staff members to a specific 'Branch' of their company and subsequently add jobs provided by these customers. For example, a customer 'CompanyX' may request to the RATS company manager
that they need a Typist who knows shorthand and can work on site. This job then gets paired with an appropriate staff member from the system. When the job is completed, the staff member returns and is available for a new job.

There is a Tester class with code demonstrating how the system would be used. However, ultimately, the system would be used via the Java Swing GUI created.
